# Deep-Learning-based-Feature-Extraction-with-sMRI-data-in-Neuroimaging-Genetics-for-Alzheimer's-Disease
In this paper, the authors propose a method of finding genetic varinats responsible for the Alzheimer's Disease with the help of features derived from the Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. As a result, the analysis is primarily divided in two parts. Firstly, we used a convolution neural network (CNN) model to perform an automatic extraction from the MRI images. This part of the coding has been done using Python in Jupyter notebook. For the second part, we used regression models to find the genetic variants responsible for the ALzheimers Disease.

Part I (Convolution Neural Network in Python): 



















Part II (Regression model for the genetics model):
